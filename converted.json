Could this be that most elusive of Brexit developments: progress?\n\nNot exactly. For many reasons \u2013 politics, self-interest, the fundamentally incoherent task at hand \u2013 May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are unlikely to hash out a workable agreement about how Britain should exit the EU. If they fail, May says she\u2019ll let Parliament settle the matter by voting on various options, through a yet-to-be-determined process.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine a breakthrough there, as well. Lawmakers have spent recent days rejecting just about every theoretical variant of Brexit. May\u2019s plan has been voted down three times since January. Even the least-unpopular alternatives \u2013 such as adding a permanent customs union to the political declaration attached to May\u2019s withdrawal agreement \u2013 would require a steady cross-party alliance, which on current trends looks implausible.\n\nAnd the underlying problems haven\u2019t gone away. Although the public voted for Brexit in the abstract, all specific versions of it find little support. That\u2019s because they all would, to varying degrees, reduce growth, harm businesses, diminish Britain\u2019s standing in the world and quite possibly impinge on its sovereignty by binding it to EU rules it will no longer have a say over. As ever in this misadventure, the choices are between bad and worse.\n\nEven so, what should happen now isn\u2019t in doubt: The government should seek a long extension of the Article 50 process that underpins Brexit, and plan for a second referendum \u2013 with Remain as an option on the ballot, alongside whatever deal May or her successor manages to devise. Britain\u2019s citizens deserve a chance to decide whether the Brexit on offer bears any resemblance to what they thought they were voting for in 2016, and should be given the opportunity to think again.\n\nGranted, further delay and indecision will be costly. The chaos of the past few years in British politics has already done great harm. Investment has declined for four straight quarters. Confidence is plummeting. Manufacturers have been stockpiling at a record rate, incurring needless expense and limiting future growth. By several estimates, Brexit has already reduced GDP by at least 2 percent. Meanwhile, other public business has all but come to a halt.\n\nPerhaps new cross-party deliberations could fashion a proposal acceptable to the House of Commons and the EU, and deliver some sort of Brexit sooner rather than later. But that wouldn\u2019t be the end of it: With or without May\u2019s withdrawal agreement, Brexit will be a prolonged process, involving years of further negotiation, debate, lawyering, rule-writing, bean-counting, politicking, infighting and generalized tedium. It will be costly, complicated and socially corrosive.\n\nAvoiding Brexit altogether is still the best way forward, even if it means further delay and the costs that go with it.

It should show no mercy.\n\nLabour\u2019s proposed Brexit deal would sign Britain up to the customs union and enter a state of \u201cdynamic alignment\u201d with the rules of the single market. This is not the equivalent of a Norway-style deal, because it allows Britain to participate fully in the single market \u2013 with the obligation to accept freedom of movement \u2013 but to diverge over time by paying a price in lost market access.\n\nIf May can accept this to the letter, and is prepared to whip her MPs for it, splitting the Tory party for a generation, Corbyn should consider the offer. But I doubt she will do so. Indeed, I doubt she will retain a shred of authority once the Tory grassroots and backbenches understand the scale of the climbdown she has made.\n\nIn that case, we are in for a rapid knockout competition in parliament, the result of which will likely see either the customs union or a full Norway-style deal get a majority.\n\nBut what\u2019s crucial now is that any deal done must be put to a second referendum, with remain as the other option.\n\nFor the past two years, it has been pro-remain progressives who advocated a second referendum. Now, all possible outcomes look so far away from the fantasies sold to leave voters that they need to be given the option to decide whether remain is better.\n\nDespite getting six million signatures on a petition, the simple revocation of article 50 would have zero democratic legitimacy.

All the deep polling shows this is nonsense. There have, as promises turned to dust, been clear swings among working-class women, Muslim voters and low-paid young people, leaving a polling majority for remain.\n\nFor certain, a second referendum will be difficult.

None secured a majority on Monday night, though a customs union with the EU was only defeated by three votes. A plebiscite on the terms of departure missed by 12. Plainly there is a consensus waiting to be found. Mrs May remains boxed in by her own red lines and those of her hardliners. If she were to soften Brexit, she risks her colleagues not supporting her in a vote of confidence. If she does not, Mrs May faces the same threat from the majority in parliament who have already voted to prevent no deal.\n\nMrs May may be tempted by self-interest for an early election.

Having lived for years now away from the Westminster bubble, I am clear that even if parliament struggles to an 11th-hour compromise on Monday, there will be little buy-in from the public. And even if for a moment there are sighs of relief, the country will still be as divided as ever.\n\nOpinion poll after opinion poll has rejected not just Theresa May\u2019s deal and the no-deal option, but the Canada, Norway, Switzerland and Efta options, the last three of which would leave Britain as a rule-taker rather than a rule-maker. And while MPs deserve credit for trying, there is unlikely to be a majority in the country for a deal cobbled together over a weekend on the basis of MPs\u2019 third or fourth choices that could decide the next 100 years of our history.\n\n\nBrexit: as May's deal is defeated for the third time, the next steps explained\n Read more\nThere are some precedents from the last two centuries to guide us when there is both a standoff between government and parliament, and a deadlock within parliament itself. Ending the impasse over the Corn Laws, dealing with Irish independence, legislating the extension of the vote from 1832 onwards, and more recently dealing with the undemocratic power of the House of Lords all required the same innovative leadership and the courage to break with the past that we need today.\n\nBut from next week we face a challenge comparable to, or greater than, all of these: how we deal with both a stalemate on policy, and a complete breakdown of trust between parliament and the public. And there can be no outcome acceptable to the British people that does not find new and effective ways of engaging with them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as one door closes, another is opening. Last week the European council showed an openness to what we might call \u2013 if the word \u201cmeaningful\u201d had not been so devalued \u2013 a meaningful extension: a longer negotiating period, not as a delaying tactic or for a return to vicious squabbling, but to reunite a divided country. And we should do what should have been done three years ago: establish region-by-region public hearings to allow straight talking and clear thinking about the concerns that brought about Brexit in the first place. A year\u2019s extension would allow us to pursue a British version of Ireland\u2019s successful experience in participatory democracy when they held citizens\u2019 assemblies, to find common ground on deeply divisive issues in advance of a referendum.\n\nThere were many concerns raised by the British public in the 2016 EU referendum, such as the state of our manufacturing and our industrial towns, and a feeling that our politicians had let us down and had lost the plot in our post-imperial journey. But when it came to the specifics of Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe, the issues that dominated were those of \u201ctaking back control of our borders\u201d, and \u201ctaking back control of our laws\u201d. These issues have been little discussed over the past three years as parliament has been engrossed in the minutiae of Brexit, and possible solutions to them need to be scrutinised in nationwide consultations in advance of any future referendum.\n\nOptions for more \u201ccontrol of our laws\u201d could include parliament passing a UK law that any decision of the European court that offends our national and constitutional identity, and is thus in violation of article 4 (2) of the treaty of Lisbon, is unconstitutional. Options for more \u201ccontrol of our borders\u201d could include registering migrants as they arrive, as Germany does, and imposing a time limit on any stay without gaining employment, as in Belgium. And outlawing, as France has, social dumping: the practice of paying Latvian workers only Latvian wages while working in France.\n\nAll these changes are achievable within the EU\u2019s freedom of movement rules.
